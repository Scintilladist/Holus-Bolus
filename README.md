# Holus-Bolus
Holus-bolus  is a simple and effective means to make your home truly "Smart". 
It connects home appliances to a central hub or a 'GATEWAY'. 
The user can interact with all the devices connected, wirelessly. 


Holus-bolus has 3 main functions:
1. Monitor Temperature and Humidity
2. Control Appliances like Air Conditioner and Lighting
3. Get intruder alerts  

Holus-bolus works on the principle of Communication between two Raspberry Pis, one acting as the Controller and other as Server. 
With the help of DHT11 sensor, temperature and humidity of a given environment is monitored and this information is fed to the app, notifying the User to act upon it when necessary.  
The user can turn on/off his home appliances such as Air Conditioner, Television, Lighting and Fans, remotely using the App. 
The device enables the user to access Real-Time intruder alerts, thereby not only securing the house but also making it a smart place.
